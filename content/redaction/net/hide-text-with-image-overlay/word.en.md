      **[GroupDocs.Redaction for .NET](https://products.groupdocs.com/redaction/net/):** Advanced Watermarking library for .NET applications. Empower your solution and secure documents with watermarks just in time.
      
      1. **Core Class: Watermarker.** The main class of our API is Redactor. You need to instantiate it before document processing. Do not forget to pass the Word file to the constructor as a path or a stream object.
      2. **Crafting Your Watermark.** The next step is constructing a Watermark object of the desired type. It can be placed not only on a specific document page but also in native document parts like images or headers.
      3. **Fine-Tuning Appearance.** Set watermark properties such as height and width, top, left, central alignments, fonts and colors, etc.
      4. **Applying and Saving.** Use the {{TextWatermarkerBold}} method to add a new watermark. Feel free to add as many watermarks as you need. You may save the watermarked document to any location.
