    "title": "What is Metadata Redaction?",
    "h1": "Redaction refers to the removal of unwanted or confidential information from electronic documents. All the file formats including PDF, DOC, DOCX, PPT, PPTX, XLS, XLSX and others have some metadata properties. These properties include author name, category, company name, comments, creation time, last updated and many more. Sometimes you need to completely delete unwanted metadata fields or you might want to update their values. There are also some hidden data associated with the files which can be viewed using various tools and techniques. There are many cases when you don't want this data to be accessed by anyone. With GroupDocs.Redaction API you can apply metadata redactions to any of these metadata properties. You can change or delete them by filtering the metadata you want. In this guide we will explain how you can redact author name from {{EXT}} metadata in {{ProgLang}}.",
