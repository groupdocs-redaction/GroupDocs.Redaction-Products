    "title": "What is Metadata Redaction?",
    "h1": "Metadata is a kind of data that provides information about other data. In other words you many think of metadata as references to data. It helps to summarize basic information about data which can be used to easily track and manage data. GroupDocs.Redaction for .NET is a powerful native API that allows software developers to redact sensitive and classified information from various documents types without installing any external software or third-party tool. It has provided support for various filters such as author, company, category, size of a document, created date, title, LastPrinted, comments and so on.   It helps users to apply metadata redactions to various popular documents formats like word processing documents, Excel worksheets, presentations, PDF and raster image files. Developers can also update, replace or erase metadata by applying filters or using search. Moreover, developers can easily apply multiple redactions in a single call. So better give it a try to automate your document and metadata redaction process by downloading the API and explore its basic and advanced features.",
